//! # M5 Arc 5e — the real-Linux capstone (feature `real-linux`)
//!
//! The documented drop-in from `docs/ARC-5-M5-GUEST-INTERFACE.md`: boot a **real** aarch64 Linux
//! kernel as a single EL1 guest that "owns the machine", on the interfaces the synthetic Arc 0–5
//! guests already proved sound. **No isolation content** — the thesis (Arcs 0–4) is proven on the
//! un-forgeable synthetic guests; this arc only demonstrates the already-proven hardware interface
//! carries an unmodified kernel. `hv-core`/`hv-hal` are untouched; this whole module is behind the
//! `real-linux` feature, so the default build (the CI boot-test) is byte-for-byte unchanged.
//!
//! ## The model — mostly pass-through, and one emulated device (③-a1)
//!
//! A *single* guest still owns most of the real hardware: hv-metal maps the guest RAM window and
//! the **GICv3** device pages through Stage-2, sets `HCR_EL2.IMO=0` so physical interrupts are
//! delivered straight to the guest's EL1, and lets the kernel drive the real GIC and arch-timer.
//!
//! **The PL011 is no longer among them.** Arc 5e passed a 32 MiB device window through
//! (`0x0800_0000 .. 0x0a00_0000`), which covered the UART at `0x0900_0000` — so the guest wrote its
//! console bytes straight to the hardware. That is the model this doc used to describe as
//! "pass-through, not virtualization", and it is also the reason a *second* guest could not exist:
//! two guests cannot both own one UART. ③-a1 shrank the window to 16 MiB (it now ends exactly where
//! the GIC redistributor region does, which on QEMU `virt` is exactly where the PL011 begins), so a
//! guest access to the UART faults to EL2 and is **trap-and-emulated** by [`crate::vpl011`].
//!
//! So two things trap to EL2 now: `HVC` (PSCI — Linux's `method = "hvc"`), and an `EC=0x24`
//! **Stage-2 data abort**, which [`handle_linux_sync`] routes to the emulated PL011 or reports as a
//! bring-up fault. The vGIC list-register injection path (`gic.rs`) is the *multi-guest* interrupt
//! mechanism and is still not used here — that is ③-a2, and until it lands the emulated UART is
//! transmit-only (see [`crate::vpl011`]'s module docs, which say so rather than implying otherwise).
//!
//! ## The memory contract (shared with `cargo xtask qemu-linux`)
//!
//! QEMU `-device loader` deposits three blobs in guest DRAM before hv-metal runs; hv-metal never
//! copies them — it just points the kernel's boot registers at them. hv-metal owns the low 128 MiB
//! (its image is at `0x4008_0000`); the guest owns `0x4800_0000 .. 0x8000_0000` (needs `-m 1024`).
//!
//! | blob      | guest PA      | how the kernel finds it            |
//! |-----------|---------------|------------------------------------|
//! | `Image`   | `0x4800_0000` | `ELR_EL2` (entry, arm64 boot proto)|
//! | DTB       | `0x4b00_0000` | `x0`                               |
//! | initramfs | `0x4c00_0000` | DTB `/chosen` `linux,initrd-*`     |
//!
//! ## Unsafe
//!
//! As the rest of the metal: EL2 system-register setup, the vector-table `global_asm!`, and the
//! `eret` handoff. Every block carries its justification. The Stage-2 table **writes** are no longer
//! among them — since M5 Arc 4 the tables live in a [`crate::cell::BootCell`] (never `static mut`,
//! and no longer a bare `UnsafeCell` either), so building them is ordinary safe code and their
//! exclusivity is checked rather than commented; the same discipline as `stage2.rs`/`guest.rs`.

// `crate::stage2::LINUX_RAM_BASE`/`LINUX_RAM_END`, which is what `build_stage2_from_p2m` actually
// maps. This file used to keep its own `GUEST_RAM_BASE`/`GUEST_RAM_END` literals, and by the time ⑭
// found them they reached nothing but a `writeln!` — a value in a diagnostic and in no boolean, the
// shape design-lesson #74 names.
//
// The FOURTH — xtask's loader addresses — is in a crate that cannot depend on `hv-metal` (this crate
// is workspace-excluded; it does not link for the host), so it CANNOT be folded in at compile time.
// It is bound at RUN time instead: the banner below prints these addresses, and
// `xtask::LINUX_MARKERS` asserts that whole line, so the gate fails if this file and xtask disagree.
// See `docs/ARC-5-M5-GUEST-INTERFACE.md` §5f.
